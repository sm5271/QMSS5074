        "Using a dataset composed of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images, I implemented various prediction models trying to predict x-ray images well. Building a predictive model using this data would be useful to assist with screening viral and COVID-19 pneumonia. The three prediction models I implemented were CNN, VGG16 with transfer learning, and ResNet50 with transfer learning. After discussing with my peers, I decided to implement an Inception model. \n",

The third prediction model I implemented used transfer learning with glove embeddings. After discussing models with my peers, I decided to implement two new models proposed by my peers.
